# When using a staging area, only certain tip pickups are valid with a 96-channel. 
# This protocol will use a 96-channel pipette to attempt to perform a partial tip pick up
# from right to left in slot 3. Although, picking up tips from slot 3 is valid.
# Picking up from right to left would cause the 96 head to crash into the staging area.
