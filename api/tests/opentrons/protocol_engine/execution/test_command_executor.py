"""Smoke tests for the CommandExecutor class."""

# FIXME(mm, 2024-05-23):
#
# These tests are temporarily deleted because the Pydantic v1->v2
# upgrade caused them to fail with especially inscrutable problems
# related to the Decoy mocks not working properly.
# We need to investigate and restore them.
